//! `memstead projection` — the binding (projection-promotion) command tree.
//!
//! The projection is the unit: one versioned binding per source→mem obligation
//! (bundle plan `03-projection-promotion`). The tree ships five leaves —
//! `brief`, `init`, `migrate`, `advance`, `enable`:
//!
//! - `brief` renders a binding's run-brief — the Markdown prompt an agent
//!   consumes — for a canonical binding id `<mem>/<stem>` (D3/D9), or the next
//!   due binding under `--all` (round-robin + backoff selection).
//! - `init` scaffolds a fresh v1 binding non-interactively (D8).
//! - `migrate` promotes both legacy generations into v1 bindings (D10): the
//!   root-folder `scopes|projections|ingests/` layout (gen-1) and the gen-2
//!   four-primitive store (`Projection` + flat `Ingest`).
//! - `advance` records disposition-gated sync-baseline advances (D7).
//! - `enable` adds a missing `build` / `sync` / `verify` operation block to an
//!   existing binding (D6 — the remedy a refused mutating op cites).
//!
//! This tree is the sole binding surface: the retired `ingest` and `pipeline`
//! command trees folded in here (`ingest brief` → `projection brief`,
//! `pipeline migrate` → `projection migrate`'s gen-1 path).
//!
//! Errors carry `PROJECTION_*` wire tokens (D12); the missing-workspace path is
//! single-sourced through [`crate::setup::workspace_not_initialised_error`].
