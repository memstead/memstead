# Changelog

All notable changes to Memstead are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-04

This release ships the binaries the public documentation already
describes: `v0.1.0` was tagged 71 minutes before `memstead quickstart`
and `memstead schema new` landed, so the published 0.1.0 binaries were
missing the documented newcomer happy path.

### Added
- `memstead quickstart` and `memstead schema new` — the two-command cold start.
  One `quickstart` run creates the workspace, a mem pinned to the built-in
  `default` schema, a seed entity, and the MCP wiring for the agent(s) you pick
  (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI).
- CLI transport commands for git-branch workspaces: `fetch`, `pull`, `push`,
  `branch-reset`, and `remote-add`.
- `memstead mem set-description`.
- Docs site: narrative guides and the glossary page.

### Changed
- The build-flavour pair is named lean/full everywhere.
- Export resolves installed schemas on both storage backends.

### Fixed
- `branch_reset` accepts the full-ref branch form on the git-branch backend.
- The pipeline store refuses path-escaping mem/name values.
- Archive read paths enforce the validator's decompression caps.
- The entity loader survives parser panics (per-file isolation boundary).
- Folder-backend archive assembly resolves installed schemas on publish.
- Cold-start round-1 text fixes: `create --help` documents the `--relation`
  filesystem-mem limitation and the `--from` JSON `entity_type` field name;
  built-in schema texts no longer claim an open relationship vocabulary;
  `install.sh` states the `.ai`/`.io`/GitHub origin relationship.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-02

First tagged release, with pre-built binaries for macOS, Linux, and Windows
(shell installer at `https://memstead.io/install.sh` and the
`memstead/homebrew-memstead` Homebrew tap).

### Added
- Initial public release of the open engine: the schema layer, the in-memory
  store, the folder and git-branch storage backends, the `memstead` CLI, and the
  `memstead-mcp` MCP server.
